## Run 

TODO: It is possible to create binaries for the different systems and publish them using scala-cli


## Build from source

It requires [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) which can be downloaded for Linux, Windows and MacOS. 

Once you download it, you can create a binary using:

```sh
$ scala-cli package . -o wb
```

and run the program with:

```
$ ./wb
```

It is possible to package the program using any of the [scala-cli package](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/commands/package) options.
